Welcome to **nonsensify** – the VS Code extension that takes your carefully named variables and gives them the silly, nonsensical names they truly deserve. Whether you want to prank your teammates, confuse your future self, or just add a dash of chaos to your codebase, nonsensify is here for you. (And hey, with a little refinement, it could even become a serious code obfuscation tool. But where's the fun in that?)

## Features

- **Nonsensify Variables:** Instantly replace all your sensible variable names with delightfully absurd alternatives. `userData` becomes `wobbleSnarf`, `counter` becomes `flibber`, and so on.
- **Obfuscation Potential:** Want to make your code unreadable for security (or comedic) purposes? nonsensify can help!
- **One-Click Mayhem:** Activate with a single command and watch the nonsense unfold.

> _"Why write readable code when you can write memorable code?"_
